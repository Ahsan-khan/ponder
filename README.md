## ✈ Travel Track

Our team embarked on a journey to create an adaptive user interface for disabled people that made it easier for them to use technology whenever they travel abroad. We spearheaded the project by creating a platform that allows users to:

- Upload the menu and extract the information from it
- Convert the extracted text from the menu into speech
- Allow micropayments to be made using Coil
- Classify the food as vegetarian or non-vegetarian
- Get nutrition information about the food, such as its ingredients and its calories

## 📚 Research

Research is paramount to gaining a full understanding of the user and their needs. Beyond our own experiences, we needed to dig deeper into the web, outside of our network, and find both organizations that could shed light on how better to help our targeted users as well as to conduct research into other similar applications or products. This was crucial to avoid re-inventing the wheel and wasting valuable time and resources. Here are a few of the resources that were helpful to us:

- **GitHub Project**: We also used GitHub for planning and keeping track of our project and its progress with the help of the GitHub project management tool.
- **Implementing the CI/CD workflow**: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.
- **Deploying the project**: Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.
- **Using PRs and Issues**: We are doing multiple PRs and building multiple issues to keep on track of the project.
